here i have implemented a regression model on cardekho dataset that predicts car price based on 12 predictors.

I also performed exploratory data analysis.

Data Modelling approach

 Check for missing values 

 Fill missing value

 Data type conversions (String to Integer)

 Remove outlier using graphs

 Convert into a normal distribution

 Built machine learning models on the data 

 Important predictors

I have tried several models and found best accuracy with the XGB regressor 
adjusted r2 score is 0.857 and mean squared error is 0.0503
